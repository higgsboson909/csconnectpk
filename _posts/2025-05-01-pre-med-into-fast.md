# How a Pre-Med Student Can Get Into FAST for Computing Programs?

If you are a pre-medical student thinking about switching to Computer Science at FAST, the first thing you need to do is pause and ask yourself one simple question: **Do I really want to do this?**  
Because this decision changes everything.

Shifting from pre-med to Computer Science is not just about choosing another degree. It is about starting fresh with a completely different mindset. If your answer is yes, and you are fully ready to commit, then do not waste any more time. **Start now.**

## The Additional Mathematics Exam

The very first requirement is the **Additional Mathematics exam**. If you are from a pre-med background, FAST makes this exam **compulsory** for admission into CS. Passing it is not optional. If you fail, your admission will be cancelled, even if you get a great score on the entry test.

This is the point where many pre-med students feel a wave of doubt. It is natural. You have spent the past two years with biology, chemistry, and physics. Now suddenly you are expected to solve **trigonometry, algebra, functions, and calculus** within a few months.  
It feels unfair. You start comparing yourself with students who have been doing maths for years. But here is the truth **It is not about how much time others had. It is about how well you use your time now.**

## How to Study Smart

The best approach is **not to study just for the sake of passing**. Learn the concepts deeply. Every topic, every example, and every exercise from your textbook matters. These same concepts will return in your first-year university courses like **Calculus, Digital Logic Design, and Programming**. Some exercises are more important than others. I remember one teacher casually saying:  

*"I would recommend solving this particular exercise twenty times."*  

He did not expect anyone to actually do that. But I did. I repeated each question in that exercise so many times that my hands started solving them automatically. It felt like I had trained my muscle memory.  

That is the level of **focus and repetition you need when you are short on time.**

## Resources You Should Use

When it comes to preparation, you might hear people say things like, *"Join KIPS"* or *"Go to an academy."*  

But honestly, **you can prepare much more effectively at home**.

- Watch the full **<a class="resource" href="https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL5b9mn6-ELrHhjcb17nu1d8Zxcogj2gFP&si=5_i8goKLi5YUURI_" target="_blank">Hashim Zia playlist on YouTube</a>**. It is one of the best and most complete resources for the FAST entry test.
- Practice from **KIPS books**.
- Solve **<a class="resource" href="https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL5b9mn6-ELrGzCLF4mypzRNHQaa24BtH6&si=rvFpLJHkGke4KC-t" target="_blank">FAST past papers</a>** to get familiar with the paper style.
- Keep your **FSc books** close, because they form your base.

If you ever get stuck on a question, especially from KIPS books, use the **<a class="resource" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=io.maqsad" target="_blank">Maqsad App</a>** (Not a paid promotion; it was genuinely helpful for me). Its doubt-solve feature is extremely helpful. You just take a picture of your question, and it gives you a clear and fast solution.  
It can save hours of confusion.

## Discipline Matters More Than Hours

Another thing that really helps is having a routine. If you find it hard to stay focused at home, study at a teacher’s place or somewhere outside your room. What matters is **consistency**. You do not need to study all day, but you do need to study every day.

## Entry Test Options

Once your Additional Maths exam is cleared, you can apply to FAST through one of three options:

- **SAT**
- **NAT**
- **NU Entry Test**

For most students, especially those from a pre-med background, the **NU Entry Test** is the most suitable. It is designed with FAST's own format and is the easiest to prepare for using Hashim Zia’s videos.

## Final Advice

In the end, remember this. Just because you did not study maths in college does not mean you cannot succeed in CS. You are not behind. You are just coming from a different starting point. What matters now is **how committed you are and how well you manage your time and energy.**

The road is not easy, but it is clear. **Stay consistent. Practice with purpose. Use the right resources. Believe that you can catch up.** And once you do, you will not just pass the test. You will **walk into FAST with confidence**, knowing you earned your seat in one of the top CS programs in Pakistan.
